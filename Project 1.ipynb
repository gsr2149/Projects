The most efficient way to find a prime number is through using the square root function in Python, known as `sqrt`.

A module, as defined by Python's official documentation, is \"Python's way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter.

We only need to check up to the `sqrt` of $n$ because any factor larger than the square root of $n$ would have a factor smaller than  `sqrt` $n$ that corresponds to it.
